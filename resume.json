      "summary": "Built and directed agile teams responsible for launching new brands and extending Stella & Dot's microservice-based architecture.",
      "highlights": [
        "Hired, managed, and directed three agile teams focused around Stella's core architecture.",
        "Launched everskin.com, the third brand in the Stella & Dot Family of Brands, growing to $500,000 annual revenue. Travelled extensively to California to guide an on-site team during the development for this new brand, over a nine month period. Built multi-brand capability into the evolving rails-based microservice API layer to support multiple lines of business from the same platform.",
        "Key role in migration of the core Stella & Dot line of business onto new rails-based microservice platform. Hired to build two additional teams in support of this migration, a combination of full-time and contract. Collaborated with 6 other teams and their directors to successfully migrate Stella & Dot smoothly onto the new platform in August of 2017, the culmination of 3 years of work on the platform and a year of heads-down focus on preparation for the migration.",
        "Worked closely with Principal Engineers to move Stella & Dot towards continuous deployment. Adopted Docker containers across my teams and helped propel Stella & Dot to wider use of Docker for dynamically generated QA environments. Moved from bi-weekly or even less frequent deploy cycle where teams took turns to an automated daily deploy train, allowing over 7 teams to contribute code to production each day. Greatly simplified the Git workflow for all teams during the move to a daily deploy train.",
        "Key participant in offsite week-long architecture and planning sessions for major shifts in the company, including the big migration from PHP/Magento to the new Rails-based microservice platform, and to guide the company's annual technical direction.",
        "Led major platform-wide implementations affecting all three lines of business, including Backorder capability, generating $350,000 in revenue during the first year of implementation, and Subscription capability (both auto-ship and memberships), generating $3,600,000 revenue during the first year of implementation.",
        "Oversaw technical improvements to the microservice API layer, in aid of all three lines of business, including adoption of widespread use of feature flags via LaunchDarkly, enabling more frequent deployment of completed user stories, expanded use of Elastic, via the repository pattern, to help integrate non-rails internal systems, such as Stella & Dot's Commissions and Genealogy service, and use of RabbitMQ exchanges to broadcast messages for use among multiple microservices, decoupling subscriber services from broadcast services.",
        "Moved Stella & Dot to constantly improve the production support processes, including a move to a daily PRS rotation among engineers, with 1st and 3rd line splits to ensure appropriate care and attention.",
        "Continuously improved practices across three teams, directly managing engineers on each and growing strong technical leads for each team. Led retrospectives and tracked key take-aways for the teams, and performed many duties normally associated with a Scrum Master. Led architecture and design sessions ahead of development, and maintained a close eye from inception to post-production, in conjunction with my technical leads. Promoted an environment of constant collaboration, taking seriously the spirit of Agile (a card, a conversation, a confirmation) much more so than the structure (Scrum in this case)."

I was privileged to report directly to Warren; I grew quickly under his leadership, and our team successfully navigated our biggest challenges with him at the helm. In a senior leaderships role, Warren has so much to offer to any organization lucky enough to have him, and I look forward to the opportunity to work with him again."
